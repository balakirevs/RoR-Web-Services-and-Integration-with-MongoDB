# Module 4, Summative Assignment: Web Services

This assignment will evaluate your ability to implement a
[RMM Level Two (2) REST-based Web Service](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html)
consisting of:

  * URIs
  * URI, Query, and Post Data Parameters
  * HTTP Methods
  * Error Status Responses
  * Representations with JSON and XML
  * Resource Implementations with JSON
  * Headers and Caching
  * and an HTTP Client

The functional goal of the assignment is to:

  * Implement a REST-based Web Service to have access to `Race` and `Entrant`
  information by re-using the previous assignment's data tier and HTML page levels
  * Implement `Race` result reporting through an HTTP Web Service interface
  using JSON
  * Implement cache re-validation headers to limit the amount of server-side
  work required to keep client copies of race results up to date.

This assignment requires you to base your solution from the "triresults" 
application you constructed in the previous module. The instructions of this 
assignment are focused at the HTTP level. However, you are free to also 
visualize your changes to the database using the web pages constructed 
in the previous assignment.

The length of the assignment is partially due to the many examples shown
throughout each section. The core of this assignment is within the Web 
Service tier. When relevant, you will be given solution **hints** to remind
you of how things work in the data tier.


## Functional Requirements

1. Implement web service access to get information for `racer` and `race` resources.

2. Implement web service access to perform basic CRUD for `race`s.

3. Implement error handling required to provide proper error feedback
to web service clients.

4. Implement web service access to obtain XML and JSON representations for `race`s.

5. Implement web service access for race result reporting updates and status.

6. Implement web caching to more efficiently keep web service clients in sync
with results.

## Getting Started

1. Start your MongoDB server using `mongod`.

2. Create a copy of your `triresults` solution from the previous module
to begin focusing on the web service requirements for this module.

    ```shell
    $ cp -r triresults (new_location)
    $ cd (new location)
    ```

3. Remove your rspec tests from the previous assignment.

    ```shell
    $ rm -rf spec/*
    ```

4. Optionally change your database. If you cloned the application with the
original `config/mongoid.yml` file, the two applications will share the same
database. If you decide to separate the two, edit the following lines.

    ```yaml
    development:
      clients:
        default:
          database: (new_name)_development
    test:
      clients:
        default:
          database: (new_name)_test
    ```

5. Create an `app/services` directory for non-model and non-controller code.

    ```shell
    $ mkdir app/services
    ```

    Add this directory to the `eager_load_paths` using the
    `config/application.rb` file. The extra step with the paths should
    not be necessary as Rails should automatically detect and load
    classes in any directory below `app`. However, we have seen issues
    with that functionality not working once Mongoid has been added. By
    adding the following line, you can guarantee the new directory path
    will be added.

    ```ruby
    # config/application.rb
    Mongoid.load!('./config/mongoid.yml')
    config.eager_load_paths += %W( #{config.root}/app/services )
    ```

6. For testing purposes, edit the following settings in the
`config/environments/test.rb` file from their default settings.
Without these changes, the tests will detect runtime errors and
fail before getting error pages and responses from the HTTP request.
For example, a 404/NotFound status response may be the correct response
for the test and without the changes below -- any 4xx or 5xx response
will get blindly treated as a failure, regardless what status result the
test is attempting to verify.

    ```ruby
    # config/environments/test.rb
    #config.consider_all_requests_local       = true
    config.consider_all_requests_local       = false

    #config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions = false
    config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions = true
    ```

7. Use the `rails console` during your development to invoke your solutions
for the data tier. Remember to call `reload!` after making changes to your source code.

    ```ruby
    $ rails c
    > ...
    > reload!
    > ...
    ```

8. Download and extract the starter set of boostrap files for this assignment. 

    ```shell
    student-start/
    |-- Gemfile
    |-- .rspec (an important hidden file)
    `-- spec
        |-- ..._spec.rb
        |-- ..._spec.rb
        `-- data
        	  |-- races.json
        	  |-- racers.json
        	  `-- results.json
    ```

    * Overwrite your existing Gemfile with the Gemfile from the bootstrap fileset. 
    They should be nearly identical, but this is done to make sure the gems and 
    versions you use in your solution can be processed by the automated grader 
    when you submit. Any submission should be tested with this version of the file.

        **NOTE** the Gemfile includes a section added for testing.

        ```ruby
        group :test do
            gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 3.0'
            gem 'mongoid-rspec', '3.0.0'
            gem 'capybara'
        end
        ```

        as well as a new definition for the following items:

        - `tzinfo-data` gem conditionally included on Windows platforms
        - `mongoid` gem used to implement your data tier
        - `httparty` gem will be used to implement client access to your web services
        - `responders` gem to be optionally used to build responses

        ```ruby
        # Windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
        gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]
        gem 'mongoid', '~> 5.0.0'
        gem 'httparty'
        gem 'responders', '~> 2.0'
        ```

    * Add the provided json data files to your `db/` directory.

    * Add the `spec/*.rb` files provided with the bootstrap fileset to a
    corresponding  `spec/` directory within your `triresults` application. 
    These files contain tests that will help determine whether you have 
    completed the assignment. Be sure to also copy the hidden `.rspec`
    file in the root directory. 

9. Run the `bundle` command to make sure all gems are available.

    ```shell
    $ bundle
    ```

10. Ingest the sample data. This data will assist you as you build and
test your solution. The data is time-sensitive, so repeat as necessary
to continue to have upcoming races in the future.

    ```shell
    $ rake assignment:setup_data

    importing data...
    races=144, racers=1000, results=2880
    updating database: triresults_development
    updating race dates to current by (N) years
    updating birth years to current by (N) years
    updating creation and update times to (today)
    ```

    **Note** that the data ingested into the development database is not
    used for grading. The tests will generate new data in the test
    database. You can refresh your development database by repeating
    the above commands if you delete or insert data you wish to remove.

11. Run the rspec test(s) to receive feedback. `rspec` must be run from the
root directory of your application.  There are several test files provided
for this assignment. Many of those files are designed to test your code
at specific points as you proceed through the technical requirements
of this assignment.  Initially, majority of tests will (obviously)
fail until you complete the requirements necessary for them to pass.

    ```shell
    $ rspec 
    ...
    (N) examples, (N) failures, (N) pending
    ```

    To focus test feedback on a specific step of the requirements, add the specific
    file (path included) with the tests along with "-e rq##" to the rspec command 
    line to only evaluate a specific requirement. Pad all step numbers to two 
    digits.

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/uri_spec.rb -e rq02
    ...
    (N) examples, (N) failures, (N) pending
    ```

12. Implement your solution to the technical requirements and use the rspec tests 
to help verify your completed solution.

13. Submit your Rails app solution for grading.

## Technical Requirements

If you do this assignment as it is intended, you will create all
controller and view classes from scratch manually, without the aid of
any `rails generate` template commands or wholesale copy/paste of files.
You should end up with an implementation where everything added was for
a need and, ideally, because you knew why it was needed and what it
performs. The API interface is being developed separate from the HTML/UI
interface so that you can focus more on serving web service clients.

### URIs

In this section you will implement a new URI in triresults and a 
new set of controller and view classes to focus on web service API 
implementation.

1. Create a set of custom URIs within Rails to serve as resources for
posting and accessing race results using a web service interface. The
actual names for the URL parameters (e.g., `:id`, `:racer_id`) are not
important to satisfying this requirement since they will only be visible
to your controller code. The resource URIs shall be:

    * `/api/races` - to represent the collection of races
    * `/api/races/:id` - to represent a specific race
    * `/api/races/:race_id/results` - to represent all results for the
    specific race
    * `/api/races/:race_id/results/:id` - to represent a specific
    results for the specific race
    * `/api/racers` - to represent the collection of racers
    * `/api/racers/:id` - to represent a specific racer
    * `/api/racers/:racer_id/entries` - to represent a the collection
    of race entries for a specific racer
    * `/api/racers/:racer_id/entries/:id` - to represent a specific
    race entry for a specific racer
    * defined for at least GET access at this time. Do not yet
    worry about the implementation to back it.

    **Hint**: The above step is achieved by configuring your 
    [`config/routes.rb`](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)
    to have both -- new global resources for `Racer`s and `Race`s and 
    a set of nested resources to represent the dual role of `Entrant`.

    You can test your solution by using `rake routes`. There
    is no rspec test for the URIs until a follow-on step.


2. Without using `rails g` command (suggestion/recommendation - not
graded), create (a set of) controllers and empty action methods to be the 
target of the URI action requests. The purpose of these empty methods is to just 
provide a complete path that maps the URI through to a method that you will 
implement later. By default, a resource with the following URI...

    ```uri
    /api/races
    ```
    ...will be mapped to the following target for GET requests.
    ```ruby
    api/races#index
    ```
    
    A target with that value needs to be matched with a RacesController
    class within the `api` namespace or module.  A namespace can be
    implemented by placing your new controller class(es) in a sub-directory
    that matches the name of the controller in the action of the route.
    
    ```ruby
    # solution/app/controllers/api/races_controller.rb
    module Api
      class RacesController < ApplicationController
      end
    end
    ```
    
    **Note** that you have full control to tweak your controller trees how you
    see fit as long as the externally visible URI remains as specified.
    To complete this step, you must have an action method defined 
    in the controller(s) to be the routed target for each `GET` URI 
    defined in the previous step (**Hint**: `index` and `show` would be the 
    default method names for these).

    **Hint**: Check your `log/test.log` during the rspec test or the 
    server console output during development -- to see if there are
    any syntax errors being reported for your controller class(es)
    that prevent the step from passing.

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/uri_spec.rb -e rq02
    ```   

3. Provide implementations for the method stubs you created in the 
previous step to act as the target of GET requests to
the URIs implemented above.  The primary task here is to have an action
in place that can receive the call and be able to understand the URI
parameters passed.  These controller actions must

    * return a `200/OK` response and render a hard-coded plain text
    string that matches the URI used to call it.
    * continue to perform the above functionality when more complete
    implementations are added in follow-on sections for GETs and the `Accept`
    format has not been specified

    **Hint**: Wrap your initial implementations in a condition statement 
    that will only fire when content-type is not specified. Place your 
    real implementation in an else-block as this assignment implementation
    progresses. That way older tests won't fail when implementations are
    completed.

    ```ruby
    def show
      if !request.accept || request.accept == "*/*"
        render plain: "/api/racers/#{params[:racer_id]}/entries/#{params[:id]}"
      else
        #real implementation ...
      end
    end
    ```

    **Hint**: Although you know the URI template used to invoke each of your
    actions, the intent is that you locate the URI parameters from
    the `params` hash available to your code within the controller. Try
    not to cheat by looking for the complete URI called from the request
    object made accessible to the controller.

    You can demonstrate your URI access using `rails console`
    and `HTTParty`. In a separate terminal, start your `rails server`.
    The following shows the controller returning a plain text response:

    ```ruby
    > HTTParty.get("http://localhost:3000/api/races").response.body
     => "/api/races" 
    > HTTParty.get("http://localhost:3000/api/races/123").response.body
     => "/api/races/123" 
    > HTTParty.get("http://localhost:3000/api/races/123/results").response.body
     => "/api/races/123/results" 
    > HTTParty.get("http://localhost:3000/api/races/123/results/456").response.body
     => "/api/races/123/results/456" 
    > HTTParty.get("http://localhost:3000/api/racers").response.body
     => "/api/racers" 
    > HTTParty.get("http://localhost:3000/api/racers/abc").response.body
     => "/api/racers/abc" 
    > HTTParty.get("http://localhost:3000/api/racers/abc/entries").response.body
     => "/api/racers/abc/entries" 
    > HTTParty.get("http://localhost:3000/api/racers/abc/entries/def").response.body
     => "/api/racers/abc/entries/def" 
    ```

    The above calls all returned 200/OK with a 

    ```ruby
    > response=HTTParty.get("http://localhost:3000/api/racers/abc/entries/def")
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "text/plain" 
    ```

    If you call a URI not implemented, you should get a 404 
    status response.

    ```ruby
    > response=HTTParty.get("http://localhost:3000/api/racers/abc/foobar/def")
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPNotFound 404 Not Found  readbody=true> 
    ```

    **Hint**: If you fail the test because your application correctly returned
    a 404/NotFound for the bogus URI, then make sure you have updated your 
    `config/environments/test.rb` file as described in the `Getting Started`
    section above.
    
    ```ruby
    ActionController::RoutingError:
           No route matches [GET] "/api/races/abc/foo/def"
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/uri_spec.rb -e rq03
    ```

4. Implement a controller method to act as the target of POST requests
to the `/api/races` URI implemented above.  The primary task here is
to have an action in place that can receive the call. This method must:

    * render a `200/OK` response. The content of the response will not 
    be checked. **Hint**: The following will render an empty response
    with a `200/OK` status response.
    
    ```ruby
      render plain: :nothing, status: :ok
    ```
    
    * continue to perform the above functionality when more complete
    implementations are added in the follow-on sections for POST and the
    `Accept` format has not been specified. **Hint**: The following will
    perform the requirements of this step when the `Accept` header is
    not supplied or has not been set to a specific MIME type.
    
    ```ruby
      if !request.accept || request.accept == "*/*"
        render plain: :nothing, status: :ok
      else
        #real implementation
      end
    ```

    **Hint**: Note that you must configure forgery protection in the
    controller class for the API to use when implementing POST HTTP method
    actions from web service clients.
    
    ```ruby
    protect_from_forgery with: :null_session
    ```

    You can demonstrate access to your new URI action using the rails 
    console.

    ```ruby
    > response=HTTParty.post("http://localhost:3000/api/races")
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/uri_spec.rb -e rq04
    ```

5. Implement a utility/service class in `app/services` called
`TriResultsWS` that can act as our primary client interface to the API.
This class must:

    * include the `HTTParty` mixin
    * declare a `base_uri` to reference your server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)

    **Hint**: The following represents an implementation of this
    requirement. The class implementation also includes a declaration
    to output debug which will include the details of the HTTP message
    exchange.

    ```ruby
    # app/services/tri_results_ws.rb
    class TriResultsWS
      include HTTParty
      debug_output $stdout
      base_uri "http://localhost:3000"
    end
    ```
    
    You can demonstrate your new web service client class using the rails 
    console after a `reload!`. If you define `debug_output` for the class
    you can see the full HTTP exchange between the client and server.
    Feel free to work at the verbosity level that you are comfortable with.

    ```text
    > reload!
    > TriResultsWS.get("/api/races")
    opening connection to localhost:3000...
    opened
    <- "GET /api/races HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0,deflate;q=0.6,identity;q=0.3\r\n
    Accept: */*\r\n
    User-Agent: Ruby\r\n
    Connection: close\r\n
    Host: localhost:3000\r\n\r\n"

    -> "HTTP/1.1 200 OK \r\n"
    -> "X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\r\n"
    -> "X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block\r\n"
    -> "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\n"
    -> "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\r\n"
    -> "Etag: W/\"b5dd0c9690b186a0e7629e3e9b2be60c\"\r\n"
    -> "Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate\r\n"
    -> "X-Request-Id: f8fa9363-6ac8-44bf-8bd2-78bccf23c1bd\r\n"
    -> "X-Runtime: 0.069018\r\n"
    -> "Server: WEBrick/1.3.1 (Ruby/2.2.2/2015-04-13)\r\n"
    -> "Date: Sun, 17 Jan 2016 02:07:55 GMT\r\n"
    -> "Content-Length: 10\r\n"
    -> "Connection: close\r\n"
    -> "\r\n"
    reading 10 bytes...
    -> ""
    -> "/api/races
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/uri_spec.rb -e rq05
    ```

### Query Parameters and POST Data

In the previous section we demonstrated how we can cause certain 
actions to fire and be passed parameters within the URI. In this 
section we will expand our options and pass in query arguments thru
two additional means:

  * query parameters
  * POST data

1. Update the controller for GET `/api/races` to handle a query 
string that represents paging parameters. This change must:

    * extract the supplied `offset` and `limit` parameters also from the 
    params object.
    * append them to the returned text string, with values within
    square braces ([]) as shown in example format below `, offset=[#{}],
    limit=[#{}]`

    You can demonstrate your handling of query parameters using the 
    rails console. Pass the query parameters as a hash to HTTParty 
    using the `:query` element.

    ```ruby
    > TriResultsWS.get("/api/races",:query=>{:offset=>4,:limit=>10}).response.body
     => "/api/races, offset=[4], limit=[10]" 
    ```

    Notice from the HTTParty debug that the query parameters were 
    passed to the server together with the URI

    ```text
    <- "GET /api/races?offset=4&limit=10 
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/params_spec.rb -e rq01
    ```

2. Update the controller for POST `/api/races` to handle POST
data. The payload will contain a `race` with the name property 
within a hash. Your method must:

    * return a status of 200/OK, Content-Type `text/plain`, and 
    the name of the `race` provided in the POST data. The following
    shows the structure of the posted payload with the `:name` 
    field the method must return back.
    ```ruby
    {:race=>{:name=>"(race name)"}}
    ```
    * continue to perform the above functionality when more complete
    implementations are added in the follow-on sections for POST and the
    `Accept` format has not been specified. **Hint**: The following
    shows how this requirement can be latched to execute only when 
    the `Accept` header is not specified or does not specify a specific
    MIME type.
    ```ruby
    if !request.accept || request.accept == "*/*"
      #return post params
    end
    ```

    You can demonstrate your new method handling using the rails console.
    In the example, we are passing the properties in the body of the
    POST using the `:body` property in the call to HTTParty.

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.post("/api/races",:body=>{:race=>{:name=>"Meager Mile"}})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.body
     => "Meager Mile" 
    ```

    Notice from the HTTParty debug that, unlike the GET, the POST data is
    not passed with the URI. It is provided in the body of the POST
    and encoded (by HTTParty) using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
    encoding.

    ```text
    <- "POST /api/races ...
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n
    \r\n"
    <- "race[name]=Meager%20Mile"
    ```

    Notice that we passed in a Ruby hash with no `Content-Type` 
    specification in the previous example. HTTParty processed the
    hash into `form encoding` format (as if it where a call from 
    an HTML form) and supplied a `Content-Type` specification
    stating it was `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding.
    If we pass HTTParty straight JSON text, it will be sent 
    unchanged but adds a `Content-Type` of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. 
    Rails will **NOT** be able to parse the content and our POST
    method will not get the parameters it needs, resulting in an error response.

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.post("/api/races",
                                 :body=>{:race=>{:name=>"Meager Mile"}}.to_json)
    > response.body
     => "" 
    ```
    ```text
    <- "POST /api/races ...
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n
    \r\n"
    <- "{\"race\":{\"name\":\"Meager Mile\"}}"
    ```

    If we do the opposite and pass a `Content-Type` without 
    the `:body` element being a JSON string format already,
    we also get a header spec and format mis-match except this
    time we get an error because the server cannot parse the 
    format we claimed the body was in.

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.post("/api/races",
                                 :body=>{:race=>{:name=>"Meager Mile"}},
                                 :headers=>{"Content-Type"=>"application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPBadRequest 400 Bad Request  readbody=true> 
    ```
    ```text
    <- "POST /api/races ...
    Content-Type: application/json\r\n
    \r\n"
    <- "race[name]=Meager%20Mile"
    ```

    If we provide a JSON string in the `:body` and a matching `application/json`
    in the `:header` for `Content-Type`, our method can be called using 
    a JSON POST body and works.

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.post("/api/races",
                                 :body=>{:race=>{:name=>"Meager Mile"}}.to_json,
                                 :headers=>{"Content-Type"=>"application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.body
     => "Meager Mile" 
    ```
    ```text
    <- "POST /api/races ...
    Content-Type: application/json\r\n
    \r\n"
    <- "{\"race\":{\"name\":\"Meager Mile\"}}"
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/params_spec.rb -e rq02
    ```

### Methods

In this section you are going to demonstrate a more complete vocabulary
of HTTP method implementations using the data tier copied over from
the previous module. In a previous section, you were required to expose
specific URIs, but only required to implement GETs and a single POST.
That left you many choices in how to proceed with the assignment. In
this section you will need to have POST in place for the `api/races`
URI and a GET, PUT, and DELETE in place for the `/api/races/:id` URI.
You are not restricted in how you achieve the mapping from URI and HTTP
Method to the controller#action as long as you have an action in place
that provides the required behavior below.

1. Implement POST `/api/races` to create a new `Race` in the database.
Note that some of the requirements listed are automatically done for
you by the server.  This action must:

    * accept a JSON string in the POST body with name and date
    
    ```
    "{\"race\":{\"name\":\"First Race\",\"date\":\"2016-01-17\"}}"
    ```
    
    * add a new `Race` to the database with that name and date
    * return a `201/CREATED` status with a `text/plain` response 
    with the race name. **Hint**: use `status: :created` to supply
    the non-default `201/CREATED` status.
    
    ```ruby
    render plain: name, status: :created
    ```
    
    * not eliminate the stub behavior implemented for these methods in 
    the earlier URI and parameter sections when Accept is not supplied.
    (**Hint**: Implement this behavior when `request.accept` is not nil and
    not equal to `*/*`)

    You can test out your new implementation using the rails console.
    In the example below, we explicitly create a JSON formatted string
    with the `Race` data and then POST that information using the 
    appropriate `Content-Type` in the header. Note that we must provide
    an `Accept` header to bypass our earlier stub implementations.

    ```ruby
    > json_string={race:{name:"First Race", date:Date.current.iso8601}}.to_json
     => "{\"race\":{\"name\":\"First Race\",\"date\":\"2016-01-17\"}}" 
    > response=TriResultsWS.post("/api/races",
                                 :body=>json_string,
                                 :headers=>{"Content-Type"=>"application/json",
                                            "Accept"=>"text/plain"})
    ```

    The response should be a `201/CREATED` and we should be able to 
    locate the new `Race` in the database based in the inputs provided.
    If your response was `200/OK`, check that your controller logic is 
    not falling into the stub implementation implemented earlier. 

    ```ruby
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPCreated 201 Created  readbody=true> 
    2.2.2 :130 > response.body
     => "First Race" 

    > pp Race.find_by(:name=>"First Race", :date=>Date.current).attributes
    {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('569bd20ee301d0aa30000000'),
     "next_bib"=>0,
     "n"=>"First Race",
     "date"=>2016-01-17 00:00:00 UTC,
     "updated_at"=>2016-01-17 17:40:30 UTC,
     "created_at"=>2016-01-17 17:40:30 UTC}
    ```

    **Note** there are several ways you could have tried to implement
    using the parameters to create the race and many of them likely 
    failed due to a `ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError`.

    * **Passed explicit hash arguments**:  This would have worked but is verbose
    and undesirable as the number of arguments increase.
    
    ```ruby
    race=Race.create(:name=>params[:race][:name], :date=>params[:race][:date])
    ```
    
    * **Direct mass assignment**:  Here you know that `:race` should have two 
    elements with the exact names you would have used to create this `Race`
    using Mongoid in the rails console. We can use the debugger or log statements
    to help demonstrate.
    
    ```ruby
    (byebug) params[:race]
    {"name"=>"First Race", "date"=>"2016-01-17"}
    race=Race.create(params[:race])
    ```
    This does not work because of security measures Rails has put into place 
    to prevent callers from adding anything they want to the data tier thru
    the mass assignment technique that is common within Rails. If you look 
    close in a debugger session, you will notice that the parameters are 
    not a hash type.
    
    ```ruby
    (byebug) params[:race].class
    ActionController::Parameters
    ```
    
    ActiveModel implementations (i.e., Mongoid) will not accept parameters
    of this type that have not been inspected and white-listed for processing.
    
    * **Hash mass assignment**: We can bypass Rails security measures and 
    blindly turn our `ActionController::Parameters` into a Ruby hash. This
    will work but leaves you open to every parameter passed in being passed
    to the model.
    
    ```ruby
    race=Race.create(params[:race].to_hash)
    ```
    
    You can fix that slightly using `slice`, 
    
    ```ruby
    race=Race.create(params[:race].to_hash.slice(:name, :date))
    ```
    but Rails has a more standard approach to addressing this using white-listing

    * **White-listed mass assignment**: The `ActionController::Parameters`
    type has a set of methods (`require` and `permit`) that scale the 
    parameters down to a set of white-listed values. A version of this
    was generated for you by `rails g` scaffold commands for the web
    pages generated in the previous module.
    
    ```
    race=Race.create(race_params)
    ...
    private
      def race_params
        params.require(:race).permit(:name, :date)
      end
    ```
    
    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/methods_spec.rb -e rq01
    ```

2. Implement GET `/api/races/:id` to retrieve an existing `Race` from 
the database. This action must:

    * accept the ID of the `Race` as a URI parameter as designed in
    the URI design section of this assignment
    * find the Race in the database
    * return a 200/OK response and a rendering of the `Race` as JSON.
    **Hint**: You can have the default JSON rendering applied using the 
    following in your method:
    
    ```ruby
    render json: race
    ```
    
    * not eliminate the stub behavior implemented for these methods in 
    the earlier URI and parameter sections when Accept is not supplied.
    (**Hint**: Implement this behavior when `request.accept` is not nil and
    not equal to `*/*`)

    You can test your new method using the rails console. In the 
    following example we locate a specific race in the database
    and use it in forming a URI passed in the GET to the server.


    ```ruby
    > race=Race.find_by(:name=>"First Race", :date=>Date.current)
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}",
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    ```

    The action returns a `200/OK` status with a `Content-Type`
    of `application/json` and a payload. **Note** that this is the 
    default JSON rendering of the object from the database and 
    contains database information we may or may not have wanted 
    to be passed to the caller.

    ```ruby
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "application/json" 
    > pp response.parsed_response
    {"_id"=>{"$oid"=>"569bd20ee301d0aa30000000"},
     "created_at"=>"2016-01-17T17:40:30.540Z",
     "date"=>"2016-01-17",
     "loc"=>nil,
     "n"=>"First Race",
     "next_bib"=>2,
     "updated_at"=>"2016-01-17T17:40:30.540Z"}
    ```

    If you are receiving a `text/plain` response from the stub
    created in the earlier URI section, verify that you have 
    properly updated your logic such that you perform real actions
    when an `Accept` header is provided.

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/methods_spec.rb -e rq02
    ```

3. Execute HEAD `/api/races/:id` as an example of how you could 
determine if a race ID existed without having to receive a rendering
of the race.

    You can demonstrate the use of HEAD with the rails console
    and the ID used in the previous step. **Note** that we still
    need to provide an `Accept` header otherwise we will fall
    back to the stub implementation implemented during the URI
    section.

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.head("/api/races/#{race.id}",
               :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_length
     => 0 
    ```

    You can also demonstrate when the resource cannot be 
    found using this method.

    ```ruby
    > TriResultsWS.head("/api/races/bogus",
       :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"}).response
     => #<Net::HTTPNotFound 404 Not Found  readbody=true> 
    ```

    There is no rspec test for this step.
    
4. Implement PUT `/api/races/:id` to replace the values of a 
specific `Race`. Some of the requirements listed below are
handled for you by the server. This action must:

    * accept the ID of the `Race` as a URI parameter as designed in
    the URI design section of this assignment
    * accept a JSON string in the payload data of the HTTP method
    * replace the Race in the database with the supplied values.
    * return a 200/OK response and a rendering of the `Race` as JSON.
    
    **Hint**: You can have the default JSON rendering applied using the 
    following in your method:
    
    ```ruby
    render json: race
    ```
    
    **Hint**: Avoid the `ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError` error
    by re-using the same technique you used during POST
    to get white-listed values to pass to Mongoid.

    You can demonstrate your new action using the rails console.
    In the example below, we:

    * locate a race in the database and verify its name. 
    * explicitly form a JSON string (from a hash) that has the new
    values we want the race replaced with.
    * invoke PUT on the URI, providing the JSON string and `Content-Type`
    * receive a 200/OK status code indicating success 

    ```ruby
    > race=Race.find_by(:name=>"First Race", :date=>Date.current)                                                         
    > race.name
     => "First Race" 
    > json_string={race:{name:"Modified Race", date:Date.current.iso8601}}.to_json                                        
     => "{\"race\":{\"name\":\"Modified Race\",\"date\":\"2016-01-17\"}}" 
    > response=TriResultsWS.put("/api/races/#{race.id}",
                                :body=>json_string,
                                :headers=>{"Content-Type"=>"application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    ```

    **Note** that an `Accept` header was not necessary since we did not 
    implement a stub method for PUT commands and the controller 
    implementation is hard-coded to return `application/json`.
    We can begin verifying success by inspecting the returned payload
    and note that the name (and date) have be replaced.

    ```ruby
    > response.content_type
     => "application/json" 
    > pp response.parsed_response
    {"_id"=>{"$oid"=>"569bd20ee301d0aa30000000"},
     "created_at"=>"2016-01-17T17:40:30.540Z",
     "date"=>"2016-01-17",
     "loc"=>nil,
     "n"=>"Modified Race",
     "next_bib"=>17,
     "updated_at"=>"2016-01-17T19:47:54.990Z"}
    ```

    We can also verify the state of the race by locating it directly 
    within the database.

    ```ruby
    > Race.find(race.id).name
     => "Modified Race" 
        > pp Race.find(race.id).attributes
    {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('569bd20ee301d0aa30000000'),
     "next_bib"=>17,
     "n"=>"Modified Race",
     "date"=>2016-01-17 00:00:00 UTC,
     "updated_at"=>2016-01-17 19:47:54 UTC,
     "created_at"=>2016-01-17 17:40:30 UTC}
    ```

    One thing to note about the state of the database. You will
    notice that `next_bib` is greater than zero (0) even though we 
    have not assigned a single `Entrant`. That is because the 
    default JSON marshaller is calling the getter for `next_bib`
    each time we request the object and this is incrementing the
    `next_bib` value in the database.

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/methods_spec.rb -e rq04
    ```

5. **Note** that you can also invoke the same action as PUT with a PATCH
command and determine which was actually being called by inspecting the
`request`. PUT is meant to be a replacement and PATCH is meant to be
a partial update. How you implement that is up to you but it can make a
difference to an Internet cache when is sees a PUT ("possibly cache - that
will be the new state of the resource") versus a PATCH ("don't cache --
that is only a partial update to the state of the resource").  The easiest
way to think of this is to consider a URI referencing a document and the
PUT overwrites the document and the PATCH makes changes to the document.


    To verify this point, lets insert a debug statement in our action
    to print out the HTTP method called.

    ```ruby
    # PUT,PATCH /api/races/:id
    def update
      Rails.logger.debug("method=#{request.method}")
      race=Race.find(params[:id])
    ```

    When we issue a PUT, we get a method=PUT in the rails server output.
    Although not always enabled for a URI -- an intermediate Internet 
    cache between the callers and this service may believe the state 
    passed in is a full replacement for what will be served by the 
    next GET.

    ```text
    Started PUT "/api/races/569c01b2e301d0cbcf000001" for 127.0.0.1 at 2016-01-17 16:15:52 -0500
    Processing by Api::RacesController#update as HTML
      Parameters: {"race"=>{"name"=>"Modified Race", "date"=>"2016-01-17"}, "id"=>"569c01b2e301d0cbcf000001"}
    Can't verify CSRF token authenticity
    method=PUT
    ```

    When we issue a PATCH, we get a method=PATCH in the rails server output.
    This will allow us to receive partial updates and apply them accordingly
    and the intermediate Internet caches will know the incoming state was 
    not a full replacement.

    ```text
    Started PATCH "/api/races/569c01b2e301d0cbcf000001" for 127.0.0.1 at 2016-01-17 16:15:59 -0500
    Processing by Api::RacesController#update as HTML
      Parameters: {"race"=>{"name"=>"Modified Race", "date"=>"2016-01-17"}, "id"=>"569c01b2e301d0cbcf000001"}
    Can't verify CSRF token authenticity
    method=PATCH
    ```

    There are no tests for this step.

6. Implement DELETE `/api/races/:id` to destroy the race associated with
that specific `Race` ID. Some of the requirements listed below
are automatically handled for you by the server. This action must:

    * accept the ID of the `Race` as a URI parameter as designed in
    the URI design section of this assignment
    * remove the race with the supplied ID from the database
    * return a 204/NO-CONTENT response without any content in the response
    **Hint**: You can have the default JSON rendering applied using the 
    following in your method:
    
    ```ruby
    render :nothing=>true, :status => :no_content
    ```

    You can test your new action using the rails console. In
    the example below, we 

    * verify that our race is still in the database
    * issue a DELETE on the URI for the race
    * check the response is a 2xx-level response, indicating
    success and 204/NO CONTENT indicating success with no 
    provided response
    * verified the race is no long in the database

    ```ruby
    > Race.where(:id=>race.id).first.name
     => "Modified Race"

    > response=TriResultsWS.delete("/api/races/#{race.id}")
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPNoContent 204 No Content  readbody=true> 

    > Race.where(:id=>race.id).first
     => nil 
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/methods_spec.rb -e rq06
    ```

### Error Conditions

Up to this point we have been focusing on the "happy path" and 
satisfied when we get the correct responses for correct inputs.
However, you likely noticed that when errors did occur, the web
service client receives some unwanted information -- especially
in the Rails development environment profile. In this section you will be asked
to address error conditions in a way that provides the API caller
with a clean error response instead of an HTML page dump.

As setup for this section, observe the default
response to a PUT request for a race that does not exist.
Notice we correctly received a 404/NOT FOUND, but we also
received 97,566 bytes of HTML text -- which is of no use
to a web service client.

```
> response=TriResultsWS.put("/api/races/foobar",
                            :body=>json_string,:headers=>{"Content-Type"=>"application/json"})
> response.response
 => #<Net::HTTPNotFound 404 Not Found  readbody=true> 
> response.content_length
 => 97566 
> response.content_type
 => "text/html" 
```

1. Add rescue handling such that the exception thrown by Mongoid
when a document is not found returns a `text/plain` message with 
the ID of the document asked for. This response must:

    * return a 404/NOT FOUND status code with a text/plain Content-Type
    and a text error message with the identity of the race requested 
    located inside the text using the format `race[:id]`. Example:
    
    ```text
    woops: cannot find race[foobar]
    ```

    **Hint**: You can add a rescue block per method or you can also 
    address the requirement using a global [`rescue_from`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Rescuable/ClassMethods.html#method-i-rescue_from)
    construct within your controller class. **Note** that you can usually
    locate the specific exception thrown by looking at the server log.

    ```ruby
    rescue_from Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound do |exception|
        render plain: "woops: cannot find race[#{params[:id]}]", status: :not_found
    end
    ```

    You can demonstrate your handling of "race not found" error
    using the rails console. In the following example, we 

    * attempt to update a race that does not exist
    using a PUT
    * receive a 404/NOT FOUND as we did before
    * receive text/plain with an error message better suited for 
    a web service client
    * within the error message is the required pattern of `race[:id]`
    with `:id` being the race we requested

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.patch("/api/races/foobar",
                  :body=>json_string,:headers=>{"Content-Type"=>"application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPNotFound 404 Not Found  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "text/plain" 
    > response.content_length
     => 31 
    > response.body
     => "woops: cannot find race[foobar]" 
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/errors_spec.rb
    ```
  
### Representations

This section you will focus on rendering different representation formats
from your web service. Up to now we have limited the output to text/plain with
a minor amount of JSON. This was hard-coded in some of the hints provided 
in this assignment. Examples:

```ruby
render plain: name, status: :created
render json: race
```

In this section we are going to keep the renderings simple, but expand
it such that the client can control what `Content-Type` they receive
based on runtime requests and what is implemented by the web service.
You are required to support both `application/json` and `application/xml`
`Content-Type`s.

Since the solution will be evaluated from the API client-perspective, you 
are not constrained in how you implement the rendering decisions.
The lecture demonstrated a way to keep the rendering format separate 
from the controller in the 
[`HelloController`](https://github.com/jhu-ep-coursera/fullstack-course3-module4-wsmovies/blob/master/app/controllers/hello_controller.rb).
The [`render documentation`](http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/Base/render)
will also be of some help. The following builders will also be of interest

* [`JSON JBuilder`](http://github.com/rails/jbuilder#jbuilder)
* [`XML Builder`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Base.html)

The rails scaffold generator does mostly the same thing except
it is complicated by the re-directs required by the web page
access. The beauty of using the separate API class is that we can 
separate ourselves from the details of web page navigation and 
concentrate on completing actions.

1. Respond to a GET `/api/races/:id` request using an XML rendering
of the requested race when the request contains an `Accept:application/xml`
header. This action must:

    * be invoked using GET `/api/races/:id`
    * locate the requested `Race` by ID
    * return a 404/NOT FOUND status with an XML-formatted error message
    containing some error text in a root-level element called `msg`
    when not found. Example:
    
    ```xml
      <error>
        <msg>woops: cannot find race[foobar]</msg>
      </error>
    ```
    
    * return a 200/OK status with an XML-formatted message containing
    a representation of the requested `Race` with minimum of `name`
    and `date` elements at the root level below a `race` element. Example:
    
    ```xml
      <race>
        <name>Upper Tract Iron</name>
        <date>2014-10-20</date>
      </race>
    ```

    **Hint**: To get started, you are going to want to remove any pre-determined,
    hard-coded rendering configuration in your controller and make rendering 
    decisions based on the `Accept` header. 
    
    ```ruby
    #render json: race
    render race
    ```
    
    The `sayhello` example expressed that thru 
    [different views](https://github.com/jhu-ep-coursera/fullstack-course3-module4-wsmovies/tree/master/app/views/hello).

    You can demonstrate your ability to provide XML content when the 
    client provides an `Accept` header in the request for a GET using
    the rails console. In this example we 

    * obtain a valid race from the database
    * display the race name
    * request the race from the API, supplying the ID of the race in 
    the URI and the `Accept` header stating we would only take XML.


    ```ruby
    > race=Race.first              
    > race.name
     => "Upper Tract Iron"
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}",
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/xml"})
    ```

    We received:

    * a 200/OK status message telling us our request was satisfied
    * a `Content-Type` of `application/xml` telling us the format of the 
    body of the response
    * an XML payload body with the required name and date in root-level
    elements

    ```ruby
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "application/xml" 
    > y response.body
    --- |-
      <race>
        <name>Upper Tract Iron</name>
        <date>2014-10-20</date>
      </race>
    ```

    **Hint**: In an earlier section you added a rescue block that had hard-coded
    the response content type to `text/plain`. To complete this step, you should
    conditionally execute the previous implementation in the absence of an `Accept`
    header or a specific mime type in the header.
    
    ```ruby
    if !request.accept || request.accept == "*/*"
      render plain: "woops: cannot find race[#{params[:id]}]", status: :not_found
    else 
      #Accept-specific response here
    end
    ```

    **Hint**: One way you could implement the Accept-specific implementation
    is to define the return status and message information independent
    of the returned type. In this specific example, there would be a
    `app/views/api/error_msg.xml.builder` in place to accept the inputs
    and render a result.
    
    ```ruby
    render :status=>:not_found, 
           :template=>"api/error_msg", 
           :locals=>{ :msg=>"woops: cannot find race[#{params[:id]}]"}
    ```

    If we issue a race ID that does not exist:

    * a 404/NOT FOUND status is returned
    * Content-Type is set to `application/xml`
    * an error message is supplied in XML format

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/foobar",
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/xml"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPNotFound 404 Not Found  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "application/xml" 
    > y response.body
    --- |-
      <error>
        <msg>woops: cannot find race[foobar]</msg>
      </error>
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/representations_spec.rb -e rq01
    ```

2. Respond to a GET `/api/races/:id` request using an JSON rendering
of the requested race when the request contains an `Accept:application/json`
header. Functionally this may be the same as what you quickly implemented
with `render :json` in earlier steps, but the implementation here must 
be within a framework that allows the caller to specify the desired 
content-type rather than hard-coding the value in the action.
This action must:

    * be invoked using GET `/api/races/:id`
    * locate the requested `Race` by ID
    * return a 404/NOT FOUND status with an JSON-formatted error message
    containing some error text in a root-level property called `msg`
    when not found. Example:
    
    ```json
    {"msg"=>"woops: cannot find race[foobar]"}
    ```
    
    * return a 200/OK status with an JSON-formatted message containing
    a representation of the requested `Race` with minimum of `name`
    and `date` properties at the root level. Example:
    
    ```json
    {"name"=>"Upper Tract Iron", "date"=>"2014-10-20"}
    ```

    You can demonstrate your ability to provide JSON content when the 
    client provides an `Accept` header in the request for a GET using
    the rails console. In this example we 

    * obtain a valid race from the database
    * display the race name
    * request the race from the API, supplying the ID of the race in 
    the URI and the `Accept` header stating we would only take JSON.


    ```ruby
    > race=Race.first              
    > race.name
     => "Upper Tract Iron"
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}",
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    ```

    We received:

    * a 200/OK status message telling us our request was satisfied
    * a `Content-Type` of `application/json` telling us the format of the 
    body of the response
    * an JSON payload body with the required name and date in root-level
    elements

    ```ruby
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "application/json" 
    > response.parsed_response
     => {"name"=>"Upper Tract Iron", "date"=>"2014-10-20"} 
    ```

    If we issue a race ID that does not exist:

    * a 404/NOT FOUND status is returned
    * Content-Type is set to `application/json`
    * an error message is supplied in JSON format

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/foobar",
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPNotFound 404 Not Found  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "application/json" 
    > response.parsed_response
     => {"msg"=>"woops: cannot find race[foobar]"}
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/representations_spec.rb -e rq02
    ```

3. Respond to a GET `/api/races/:id` request using a plain text rendering
when the formats in the `Accept` header are not supported. You can make 
this another `rescue_from` case -- as you did in the previous section
on reporting errors. Your action must:

    * return a `415/UNSUPPORTED MEDIA TYPE` status with a `text/plain`
    error message stating the mime type requested in square brackets
    (i.e, content-type[#{request.accept}]) when the caller supplies
    an `Accept` header with no supported MIME types. Example:
    
    ```text
    woops: we do not support that content-type[application/foobar]
    ```
    
    * return a `200/OK` when the `Accept` header contains unsupported 
    media types mixed with a supported media type. The response type
    will be the supported type.

    **Hint**: This should only require 2-3 lines of code to implement. 
    If you find yourself implementing entire algorithms, stop and 
    review the lecture materials and examples.

    **Hint**: Note that the rescue syntax allows for the block to 
    receive the exception. If you do nothing with that exception
    you will likely loose useful information in locating the source
    of a problem. It is suggested that you log the exception to 
    restore some of the useful default behavior.
    
    ```ruby
    rescue_from ActionView::MissingTemplate do |exception|
      Rails.logger.debug exception
    ...
    ```

    You can demonstrate your new `Accept` content type error handling
    using the rails console. In this example we have provided a valid
    race ID, but an unsupported MIME type. The error response is returned
    as a `415/UNSUPPORTED MEDIA TYPE` and the message we generated 
    states the format requested.

    ```ruby
    > race=Race.first
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}",
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/foobar"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPUnsupportedMediaType 415 Unsupported Media Type  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "text/plain" 
    > response.body
     => "woops: we do not support that content-type[application/foobar]" 
    ```

    If we combine the unsupported type with a supported type, Rails will
    use the supported type.

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}",
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/foobar,application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "application/json" 
    > response.parsed_response
     => {"name"=>"Upper Tract Iron", "date"=>"2014-10-20"} 
    ```

    **Note** there are still some error cases that are beyond this assignment.
    Take into consideration the case where a client requests an invalid 
    `Race` and an unsupported MIME type. The `404/NOT FOUND` exception
    handling can throw an exception itself if it cannot locate a content
    to render the error message. That may add complications to your 
    error handlers or require errors be reported in a standard format.

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/representations_spec.rb -e rq03
    ```

### Resource Implementation (JSON)

In this section we will concentrate on implementing what is needed
to get race results from the API. In an earlier section, you designed
a `/api/race/:race_id/results` in order to represent the collection
of results for a race. Now we want to implement a GET of results
for at least JSON. Since there were no internal design requirements
of how you implemented your controller(s), you will need to 
translate some of the hints to your specific situation.

1. Update the controller method that is implementing the action
for GET `/api/races/:race_id/results/:id` so that it finds the specified
`Entrant`. This action must:

    * obtain the `:race_id` and (`Entrant`) `:id` provided in the URI
    * find the `Entrant` in the database
    * make the `Entrant` available to the view

    **Hint**: the following snippet will be of use in locating the `Entrant`
    in the database.
    
    ```ruby
    @result=Race.find(params[:race_id]).entrants.where(:id=>params[:id]).first
    ```
    
    What you are now adding should implement the stub created earlier when
    no `Accept` header was supplied.
    
    ```ruby
      if !request.accept || request.accept == "*/*"
        render plain: "/api/races/#{params[:race_id]}/results/#{params[:id]}"
      else
        #real implemenation goes here
      end
    ```

    If you used a partial to implement the view for an `Entrant` result,
    then a partial called `_result.json.jbuilder` could get invoked using
    the following:
    
    ```ruby
    render :partial=>"result", :object=>@result
    ```

    At the completion of this step you should either be:
    
    * manually calling a view similar to how the 
    [`HelloController#say method`](https://github.com/jhu-ep-coursera/fullstack-course3-module4-wsmovies/blob/master/app/controllers/hello_controller.rb)
    worked in the class examples. 
    * using automatic routing the way the `HelloController#sayhello` 
    worked in the class examples.

    With that in place, you likely are getting an error stating 
    a 404/NOT FOUND on the client-side and a template or partial
    not found on the server-side.

    There is no test for this step.


2. Implement an `XXX.json.jbuilder` script to act as the view that the
above controller is trying to render. We will use a custom view so
that we can better control what goes into the data marshalled back
to the client. The document returned to the client must have:

    * `place` - overall place
    * `time` - time formatted overall time
    * `last_name` - entrant's last_name
    * `first_name` - entrant`s first_name
    * `bib` - bib number
    * `city` - entrant's city
    * `state` - entrant's state
    * `gender` - entrant's gender (Hint: entrant.racer_gender)
    * `gender_place` - entrant's placing within gender
    * `group` - entrant's group_name (Hint: entrant.group_name)
    * `group_place` - entrant's placing within group
    * `swim` - time formatted swim time
    * `pace_100` - time formatted swim_pace_100
    * `t1` - time formatted t1_secs
    * `bike` - time formatted bike_secs
    * `mph` - formated bike_mph
    * `t2` - time formatted t2_secs
    * `run` - time formatted run_secs
    * `mmile` - time formatted run_mmile
    * `result_url` - url of this entrant's race result
    * `racer_url` - if entrant.racer.id is not nil

    When formatting time of the fields

    * time formatting should be in either HH:MM:SS format for 
    longer durations or MM:SS for shorter durations.
    * floating point numbers like MPH should be to one decimal place
    * you implemented helper methods in module 3 for the HTML pages
    to format the fields.  They can be re-used here.

    **Hint**: It is recommened that you implement this view as a partial so
    that it is re-usable when we go to render the resource collection
    in a follow-on step.  
    
    **Hint**: You should be able to use the following
    sources of information as reference

    * your `app/views/races/show.html.erb` implementation form the 
    previous assignment. The table constructed at the bottom of that
    web page will tell you where the data can be obtained from.
    * the [`JBuilder Reference Docs`](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder#jbuilder)
    * the following sample partial snippet

    ```ruby
    # .../_result.json.jbuilder
    json.place result.overall_place
    json.time format_hours result.secs
    json.last_name result.last_name
    ...
    json.mmile format_minutes result.run_mmile
    json.result_url api_race_result_url(result.race.id, result)
    if result.racer.id
      json.racer_url api_racer_url(result.racer.id)
    end
    ```

    With the controller and view in place, you can demonstrate your new
    access to the race results using the rails console. In the example
    we start by locating a race in the past with results and a sample of
    one of its entrants. **Note** that we are using the named scope `past`
    implemented in the previous assignment to easily obtain a query
    returning races that have been held prior to today.

    ```ruby
    > race=Race.past.first
    > race.name
     => "Upper Tract Iron" 
    > race.id
     => BSON::ObjectId('569a58b8e301d083c3000000') 

    > entrant=race.entrants.first
    > entrant.first_name
     => "Tiesha" 
    > entrant.last_name
     => "Beck" 
    > entrant.id
     => BSON::ObjectId('569a58bfe301d083c30007f2') 
    ```

    We now issue the request for the entrant's results using the nested
    resource `races/:race_id/results/:id` and get back a full JSON
    document with our requested data.

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}/results/#{entrant.id}", 
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "application/json" 
    > response.content_length
     => 481 
    ```

    The following contains the information for the winner.

    ```ruby
    > pp response.parsed_response
    {"place"=>1,
     "time"=>"10:17:16",
     "last_name"=>"Beck",
     "first_name"=>"Tiesha",
     "bib"=>11,
     "city"=>"Ampthill",
     "state"=>"VA",
     "gender"=>"F",
     "gender_place"=>1,
     "group"=>"30 to 39 (F)",
     "group_place"=>1,
     "swim"=>" 0:57:56",
     "pace_100"=>"01:30",
     "t1"=>"00:55",
     "bike"=>" 6:35:17",
     "mph"=>17.0,
     "t2"=>"00:41",
     "run"=>" 2:42:26",
     "mmile"=>"00:06",
     "result_url"=>
      "http://localhost:3000/api/races/569a58b8e301d083c3000000/results/569a58bfe301d083c30007f2",
     "racer_url"=>"http://localhost:3000/api/racers/569a58bde301d083c3000647"}
    ```

    Next we pick a `Race` that is upcoming to show race results that have not yet occurred.
    Notice in this rendering we are chosing to show all fields (nil and non-nil). That will
    make it easier to identify the fields when we make updates.

    ```ruby
    > race=Race.upcoming.first
    > entrant=race.entrants.first
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}/results/#{entrant.id}", 
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > pp response.parsed_response
    {"place"=>nil,
     "time"=>" 0:00:00",
     "last_name"=>"Ruiz",
     "first_name"=>"Lynwood",
     "bib"=>1,
     "city"=>"Pentagon",
     "state"=>"DC",
     "gender"=>"M",
     "gender_place"=>nil,
     "group"=>"20 to 29 (M)",
     "group_place"=>nil,
     "swim"=>nil,
     "pace_100"=>nil,
     "t1"=>nil,
     "bike"=>nil,
     "mph"=>nil,
     "t2"=>nil,
     "run"=>nil,
     "mmile"=>nil,
     "result_url"=>
      "http://localhost:3000/api/races/569a58b8e301d083c300000c/results/569a58bfe301d083c30009d2",
     "racer_url"=>"http://localhost:3000/api/racers/569a58bbe301d083c3000489"}
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/resources_spec.rb -e rq02
    ```

3. Implement a PATCH `/api/races/:race_id/results/:id` action to accept 
race result updates. This action must:

    * be callable using `PATCH /api/races/:race_id/results/:id`
    * find the `Entrant` that is associated with the `:race_id` and `:entrant_id`
    * accept a payload that is keyed by `result` and has one or more
    of the following fields in it:
    
        - swim
        - t1
        - bike
        - t2
        - run
        
	    These fields contain floating point numbers that are measuring in seconds 
	    the time taken to complete that particular leg of the race.
    * return a `200/OK` response when a successful update is made.

    **Note** how we are using PATCH here to knife into the resource 
    and tweak a few fields. We are not replacing the entire document
    with what we are posting.

    **Hint**: The previous assignment should have made the update easier
    but we are left to implement this ourselves as part of this assignment. 
    The following is a reminder of how we can 

      * initialize the results entry with the race event
      * update the time for the result

    ```ruby
    result=params[:result]
    if result
      if result[:swim]
        entrant.swim=entrant.race.race.swim
        entrant.swim_secs = result[:swim].to_f
      end
      if result[:t1]
        entrant.t1=entrant.race.race.t1
        entrant.t1_secs = result[:t1].to_f
      end
      ...
      entrant.save
    ```

    With your new PATCH action in place, you can demonstrate its functionality
    from the rails console. In the following example, we grab a random sample
    `Race` form the upcoming races and grab a random `Entrant` from that `Race`.
    The entrant starts out without any times and with equal
    `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps.

    ```ruby
    > race=Race.upcoming.to_a.sample
    > entrant=race.entrants.sample
    > Entrant.where(id:entrant.id).pluck(:created_at, :updated_at, :secs)
     => [[2016-01-17 00:00:00 UTC, 2016-01-17 00:00:00 UTC, nil]] 
    ```

    The action is called five(5) times in total, with a value for each of the 
    legs of the event. We can check the database in between calls to see 
    the `secs` and `updated_at` changing.

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.patch("/api/races/#{race.id}/results/#{entrant.id}",
                  :body=>{:result=>{:swim=>15.minute}}.to_json, 
                  :headers=>{"Content-Type"=>"application/json","Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > Entrant.where(id:entrant.id).pluck(:created_at, :updated_at, :secs)
     => [[2016-01-17 00:00:00 UTC, 2016-01-24 09:05:52 UTC, 900.0]] 
    ...
    :body=>{:result=>{:t1=>1.minute}}.to_json
    :body=>{:result=>{:bike=>40.minutes}}.to_json
    :body=>{:result=>{:t2=>40.seconds}}.to_json
    :body=>{:result=>{:run=>25.minutes}}.to_json
    > Entrant.where(id:entrant.id).pluck(:created_at, :updated_at, :secs)
     => [[2016-01-17 00:00:00 UTC, 2016-01-24 09:08:45 UTC, 4900.0]] 
    ```

	**Hint**: If you are having difficulty with passing this test due to 'CSRF token
	authenticty' types of errors, ensure all your API controllers are implementing the
	`protect_from_forgery` option, as shown with the `RacesController`.

    When we retrieve the results for the `Entrant` after posting the event times, we see that
    all times have been recorded and the overall time has been updated. The sum of the 
    leg times should equal the entrant time.

    ```
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}/results/#{entrant.id}",
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > pp response.parsed_response
    {"place"=>nil,
     "time"=>" 1:21:40",
    ...
     "swim"=>" 0:15:00",
     "pace_100"=>"02:00",
     "t1"=>"01:00",
     "bike"=>" 0:40:00",
     "mph"=>18.0,
     "t2"=>"00:40",
     "run"=>" 0:25:00",
     "mmile"=>"00:08",
    ...
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/resources_spec.rb -e rq03
    ```

4. Update the controller method that is implementing the action
for GET `/api/races/:race_id/results` so that it finds the specified `Race`
and its entrants. This action must:

    * obtain the `:race_id` provided in the URI
    * find the `Race` in the database
    * make the collection entrants for the `Race` available to the view

    **Hint**: The following is a snippet of code that you can likely 
    drop into your existing controller method implementing the action.
    
    ```ruby
    @race=Race.find(params[:race_id])
    @entrants=@race.entrants
    ```
    
    What you are now adding should implement the stub you have 
    in place from the URI section. 
    you added in the initial URI section of this assignment.
    
    ```ruby
      if !request.accept || request.accept == "*/*"
        render plain: "/api/races/#{params[:race_id]}/results"
      else 
        #implementation here
      end
    ```

    At the completion of this step you should be either be:
    
    * manually calling a view similar to how the 
    [`HelloController#say method`](https://github.com/jhu-ep-coursera/fullstack-course3-module4-wsmovies/blob/master/app/controllers/hello_controller.rb)
    worked in the class examples. 
    * using automatic routing the way the `HelloController#sayhello` 
    worked in the class examples.

    With that in place, you likely are getting an error stating 
    a 404/NOT FOUND on the client-side and a template or partial
    not found on the server-side.


    There is no test for this step.
    

5. Implement an `XXX.json.jbuilder` script to act as the view the
above controller is trying to render. We will use a custom view so that
we can better control what goes into the data marshalled back to the
client. It is recommened that the individual rows of this collection
view be implemented with the partial you recently implemented in a
previous step.  The document returned to the client must have:

    * an array element for each `Entrant` result in the collection
    * the same `Entrant` result properties defined in the previous 
    step in this section.

    **Hint**: The following snippet shows how to form the collection
    loop and invoke the partial. Dependending on what you called
    your partial and whether you even used a partial -- yours may
    look different.

    * the `ignore_nil!` was added to have nil fields not included
    in the rendered response
    * the `json.array!` iterates over the collection provided
    and passed the element into the body using the `element` variable.
    * the `json.partial!` renders the `result` partial, passing in
    `entrant` to be used as the `result` veriable in that partial.

    ```ruby
    # app/views/api/results/index.json.jbuilder
    json.ignore_nil!   #don't marshal nil values
    json.array!(@entrants) do |entrant|
      json.partial! "result", :locals=>{ :result=>entrant }
    end
    ```

    With your new controller and view in place for race results, you
    should be able to demonstrate getting race results using the rails
    console. In this example we start off by locating a race that is
    in the past. The following query makes use of a named scope `past`
    implemented in the previous assignment.

    ```ruby
    > race=Race.past.first
    > race.name
     => "Upper Tract Iron" 
    > race.date
     => Mon, 20 Oct 2014 
    ``` 

    We start off by issuing the request for the `Race`. This was implemented
    in a previous step of this assignment. This shows we are getting back the 
    `Race` we expect.

    ```ruby
    response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}",
                              :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "application/json" 
    > response.parsed_response
     => {"name"=>"Upper Tract Iron", "date"=>"2014-10-20"}               
    ```

    We now issue the request for the results using the nested collection resource 
    below the races/:race_id resource and get back a full JSON document with 
    our requested data. You may want to look at this data using a browser to 
    be able see the information better.

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}/results",
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "application/json" 
    > response.content_length
     => 9681 
    > response.parsed_response.count
     => 20 
    ```

    The following is a sample of the response showing the first place winner.

    ```ruby
    > pp response.parsed_response.first
    {"place"=>1,
     "time"=>"10:17:16",
     "last_name"=>"Beck",
     "first_name"=>"Tiesha",
     "bib"=>11,
     "city"=>"Ampthill",
     "state"=>"VA",
     "gender"=>"F",
     "gender_place"=>1,
     "group"=>"30 to 39 (F)",
     "group_place"=>1,
     "swim"=>" 0:57:56",
     "pace_100"=>"01:30",
     "t1"=>"00:55",
     "bike"=>" 6:35:17",
     "mph"=>17.0,
     "t2"=>"00:41",
     "run"=>" 2:42:26",
     "mmile"=>"00:06",
     "racer_url"=>"http://localhost:3000/api/racers/569a58bde301d083c3000647.json"}
    ```

    Next we pick a `Race` that is upcoming to show race results that have not yet occurred.

    ```ruby
    > race=Race.upcoming.first
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}/results",:headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > pp response.parsed_response.first
    {"time"=>" 0:00:00",
     "last_name"=>"Ruiz",
     "first_name"=>"Lynwood",
     "bib"=>1,
     "city"=>"Pentagon",
     "state"=>"DC",
     "gender"=>"M",
     "group"=>"20 to 29 (M)",
     "racer_url"=>"http://localhost:3000/api/racers/569a58bbe301d083c3000489.json"}
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/resources_spec.rb -e rq05
    ```

### Headers and Caching

In this section we are going to repeat some of the earlier actions except
with some conditional behavior based on caching headers.

1. Update the `results` controller so that when the collection of race
results is returned; a `Last-Modified` header is returned with it.
This value must:

    * represent the newest `updated_at` property of all `Entrant` 
    documents associated with the Race.

    **Hint**: `race.entrants.max(:updated_at)`
    **Hint**: Use [`fresh_when`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/ConditionalGet.html#method-i-fresh_when)
    to set the `Last-Modified` value as the newsest `updated_at` timestamp
    for all the entrants within the race.

    With your `Last-Modified` solution in place, you can demonstrate
    their presence using the rails console.

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}/results", 
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.header["Last-Modified"] 
     => "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 09:23:07 GMT"
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/caching_spec.rb -e rq01
    ```

2. Update the previous action to only return an update, if the client
does not already have the current version of the race results. This 
method must:

    * locate the `Race` in the database
    * locate the newest `updated_at` value for each of its `Entrants`
    * look for and process the `If-Modified-Since` header
    * compare the timestamp of the `If-Modified-Since` header with the
    newest entrant timestamp and short circuit the call (returning a
    304/Not-Modified) if the client already has the lastest copy of the
    data.

    **Hint**: Replace `fresh_when` with a conditional block using 
    [`stale?`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/ConditionalGet.html#method-i-stale-3F).

    With your new conditional logic in place, you can demonstrate this
    using the rails console. In the example below, we seed the scenario
    with an initial request of the full race results. A `Last-Modified`
    is returned, which should represent the last time updated for 
    the newest update across all `Entrants` in the Race. We can verify
    that as well.

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}/results", 
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > last_modified=response.header["Last-Modified"]
     => "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 09:23:07 GMT"
    > response.content_length
     => 6420 
    ```

    Request a copy of the `Race` results using a last-modified 
    that is up to date with the database's current state.

    ```ruby
    > last_modified
      => "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 09:34:09 GMT"
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}/results", 
               :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json",
                          "If-Modified-Since"=>last_modified})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPNotModified 304 Not Modified  readbody=true> 
    > response.header["Last-Modified"]
     => "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 09:34:09 GMT" 
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/caching_spec.rb -e rq02
    ```

3. Issue an update to one of the entrant's results and re-issue the 
GET from the previous step.

    In the following example we:
    
    * locate an entrant for a race
    * extract their URL
    * issue a result PATCH to that URL

    ```ruby
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}/results",
                                :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json"})
    > result_url=response.parsed_response.first["result_url"]
     => "http://localhost:3000/api/races/569a58b8e301d083c300008a/results/569a58c4e301d083c3002412"
    > response=HTTParty.patch(result_url,:body=>{:result=>{:swim=>15.minute}}.to_json,
              :headers=>{"Content-Type"=>"application/json","Accept"=>"application/json"})
    ```
    
    **Hint**: If you are having difficulty with passing this test due to 'CSRF token
	authenticty' types of errors, ensure all your API controllers are implementing the
	`protect_from_forgery` option, as shown with the `RacesController`.

    When we obtain the newest `updated_at` timestamp in the database for the race
    we notice that the value is now newer than the last_modified we had been using.

    ```ruby
    > last_modified
     => "Sun, 24 Jan 2016 09:08:45 GMT" 
    > race.entrants.max(:updated_at)
     => 2016-01-24 09:50:02 UTC 
    ```

    When we re-issue the GET passing the older `Last-Modified`
    timestamp in the `If-Modified-Since` header, we should get
    a `200/OK` with a full updated. This is because our latest
    updated caused the status of this resource to be newer than 
    the client previously held.

    ```ruby
    > last_modified
     => "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 09:34:09 GMT"
    > response=TriResultsWS.get("/api/races/#{race.id}/results", 
               :headers=>{"Accept"=>"application/json",
                          "If-Modified-Since"=>last_modified})
    > response.response
     => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK  readbody=true> 
    > response.content_type
     => "application/json" 
    > response.header["Last-Modified"]
     => "Sun, 24 Jan 2016 09:50:02 GMT" 
    ```

    ```shell
    $ rspec spec/caching_spec.rb -e rq03
    ```

## Self Grading/Feedback

Some unit tests have been provided in the bootstrap files and provide 
examples of tests the grader will be evaluating for when you submit 
your solution. They must be run from the project root directory.

```shell
$ rspec (file)
...
(N) examples, 0 failures
```

You can run as many specific tests you wish be adding `-e rq## -e rq##`
```shell
$ rspec (file) -e rq01 -e rq02
```

## Submission

Submit an .zip archive (other archive forms not currently supported)
with your solution root directory as the top-level (e.g., your Gemfile
and sibling files must be in the root of the archive and *not* in a
sub-folder.  The grader will replace the spec files with fresh copies
and will perform a test with different query terms.
